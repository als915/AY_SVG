# AY_SVG

# Step 1
## I added the SVG Sprite (icons.svg) and 5 SVG files labeled:
1. chicken.svg
2. cow.svg
3. horse.svg
4. pig.svg 
5. sheep.svg

# Step 2
## I added animation to all the individual SVG files
### All the SVG Animals should end on the colour matching the existing HTML page.
1. chicken.svg: I added the @keyframes chicken which includes dasharray, dashoffset, transform, stroke and fill to have the stroke and fill slowley increase opacity and change colour as they fill in. The animal also increases in size as it changes colour.
2. cow.svg: Using the same properties above the cow does the same animation, the difference beign that the colour order is different and the scale decreases. 
3. horse.svg: The same as above, but the same scale increase as the chicken.
4. pig.svg: The same as above, but the same scale decrease as the cow.svg. 
5. sheep.svg: The same as above, but the same scale increase as the chicken.
